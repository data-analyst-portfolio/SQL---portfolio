# Exercise 1: 
#(a) Use COUNT and DISTINCT to determine how many distinct skus there are in pairs of the skuinfo, skstinfo, and trnsact tables. Which skus are common to pairs of tables, or unique to specific tables?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku)
FROM skuinfo;

#1564178

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku)
FROM skstinfo;

#760212

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT sku)
FROM trnsact;

#714449
# number of distinct skus in skuinfo > number of distinct skus in skstinfo > number of distinct skus in transact

#(b) Use COUNT to determine how many instances there are of each sku associated with each store in the skstinfo table and the trnsact table?

SELECT sku, store, COUNT(*)
FROM skstinfo
GROUP BY sku, store
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

#Each sku is only counted 1 time at each store

SELECT sku, store, COUNT(*)
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY sku, store
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

#7933 is the MAX count of a any sku at any store

#Exercise 2:
#(Use COUNT and DISTINCT to determine how many distinct stores there are in the strinfo, store_msa, skstinfo, and trnsact tables.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM strinfo;

#453 stores

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM store_msa;

#333 stores

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM skstinfo;

#357 stores

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM trnsact;

#332 stores

#Exercise 3: 
#Examine some of the rows in the trnsact table that are not in the skstinfo table; can you find any common features that could explain why the cost information is missing?

SELECT trn.*
FROM trnsact trn
LEFT JOIN skstinfo skst
ON trn.sku = skst.sku AND trn.store = skst.store
WHERE skst.sku IS NULL;

# total of 52338840

#Exercise 4: 
#What is Dillard’s average profit per day?

SELECT (SUM((trn.sprice - skst.cost)* trn.quantity)/COUNT(DISTINCT saledate)) 
FROM trnsact trn
LEFT JOIN skstinfo skst
ON trn.sku = skst.sku AND trn.store = skst.store
WHERE trn.stype = 'P';

#1527903.46

# Exercise 5:
# On what day was the total value (in $) of returned goods the greatest? 
#On what day was the total number of individual returned items the greatest?

SELECT saledate, SUM(amt)
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype = 'R'
GROUP BY saledate
ORDER BY SUM(amt) DESC;

# 04/12/27  3030259.76

SELECT saledate, SUM(quantity)
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype = 'R'
GROUP BY saledate
ORDER BY COUNT(amt) DESC;

# 04/12/27  82512

#Exercise 6:
#What is the maximum price paid for an item in our database?
# What is the minimum price paid for an item in our database?

SELECT MAX(sprice), MIN(sprice)
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype = 'P';

# MAX: 6017 	MIN: 0.00

#Exercise 7:
#How many departments have more than 100 brands associated with them, and what are their descriptions?

SELECT dept.dept, COUNT(DISTINCT sku.brand) total, dept.deptdesc
FROM SKUINFO sku
JOIN DEPTINFO dept
ON sku.dept = dept.dept
GROUP BY dept.dept , dept.deptdesc
HAVING total > 100;

#3 departments – despcrtions: Environmental, Carters, Colehaan

#Exercise 8:
#Write a query that retrieves the department descriptions of each of the skus in the skstinfo table.

SELECT sku.sku, dept.deptdesc
FROM skstinfo skst
LEFT JOIN SKUINFO sku
ON skst.sku = sku.sku
JOIN DEPTINFO dept
ON sku.dept = dept.dept
GROUP BY sku.sku , dept.deptdesc;

#Exercise 9:
#What department (with department description), brand, style, and color had the greatest total value of returned items?

SELECT sku.dept, dept.deptdesc, sku.brand, sku.style, sku.color, SUM(trn.amt)
FROM skuinfo sku
JOIN trnsact trn
ON sku.sku = trn.sku
JOIN DEPTINFO dept
ON dept.dept = sku.dept
WHERE trn.stype = 'R'
GROUP BY sku.dept, dept.deptdesc, sku.brand, sku.style, sku.color
ORDER BY SUM(trn.amt) DESC;

#Exercise 10:
#In what state and zip code is the store that had the greatest total revenue during the time period #monitored in our dataset?

SELECT str.store, str.city, str.zip, SUM(trn.amt)
FROM trnsact trn
JOIN strinfo str
ON trn.store = str.store
WHERE trn.stype = 'P'
GROUP BY str.store, str.city, str.zip
ORDER BY SUM(trn.amt) DESC;
