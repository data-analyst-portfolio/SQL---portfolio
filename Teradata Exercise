## Exercise 1: (a) Use COUNT and DISTINCT to determine how many distinct skus there are in pairs of the skuinfo, skstinfo, and trnsact tables. Which skus are common to pairs of tables, or unique to specific tables?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku)
FROM skuinfo;
#1564178

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku)
FROM skstinfo;
#760212

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT sku)
FROM trnsact;
#714449
# number of distinct skus in skuinfo > number
